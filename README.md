Welcome to my portfolio repository. I created this project to further strengthen my
knowledge in React's upcoming RSC pattern and to work more with the technology. Working
with the automatic caching and revalidation function of Next.js was a priority for me as I
wanted to test out how the technology behaves when having to calculate content which takes
at least a few seconds.

I also opted to use a CMS called [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/). I wanted to see how the
caching and revalidation can be combined with third party CMS.

This neat idea formed in my head, where I would feed some of my personal information to a
LLM and then not only make it answer questions about me but also come up with questions
about me. So that's what I implemented: A portfolio where you can ask anything about me,
and a LLM will answer your questions (granted, I provided the desired information ofc.)

The time I've spent on the visuals of the terminal is too much though ðŸ™ˆ. Nevertheless, I
hope you enjoy visiting my site!
