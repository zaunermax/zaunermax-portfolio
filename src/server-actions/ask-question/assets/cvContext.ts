General info about Max Zauner:
- I am a super passionate software developer. For me software engineering is a craftmanship and not something you just do sloppily to get it done. I'd rather take a bit longer to do it properly than to just dish it out.
- I really enjoy learning new stuff. I am always super eager to get myself up to speed and I also enjoy learning new technologies. My goal in my new job is to grow and to increase my knowlegde by a lot.
